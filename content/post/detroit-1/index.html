<p>Using the <a href="https://data.detroitmi.gov">Detroit Open Data portal</a>, prepare the <a href="https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/detroitmi::parcels-2/about">Parcels</a>
and <a href="https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/detroitmi::property-sales-1/about">Sales</a> data sets for analysis. Create a basic descriptive RMarkdown report which analyzes relevant trends and data quality issues.
Contextualize your analysis with <a href="https://scholarship.law.uci.edu/ucilr/vol9/iss4/3/">key</a> <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/files/evalrespropertytaxasdetroit20162018.pdf">literature</a> on properties in Detroit.</p>
<p>Construct a classification problem for properties in Detroit and undertake an initial analysis.
I suggest that you add an additional data set from the open data portal or another source.
Searching for <em>property</em> data sets in the open data portal includes many property attributes which could be analyzed
including permits/violations/registrations/rental status/<a href="https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/detroitmi::auction-sales/about">auctions</a>/government owned property.</p>
<div id="assignment" class="section level2">
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>Instead of traditional problem sets, this course has a single four part assignment where you will build upon your previous work each week with new material from the course.
You will explore property assessment in Detroit, Michigan and create an assessment model.
After the completion of the assignment, you will wrap your model into a report which analyzes the effectiveness of your model based on the ethical and other frameworks from class and make a brief presentation to the class.</p>
